blogpost README
===============
:Author: Stuart Rackham


'blogpost' is a Wordpress command-line weblog client.  It creates and
updates weblog entries directly from
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] (or HTML) source
documents. You can also delete and list weblog entries from the
command-line.

- Manages WordPress Posts and Pages.
- Automatically uploads media files (images, video, audio).
- Only posts new or modified media files.

This 'blogpost' command creates a blogpost containing images from an
AsciiDoc text file:

Status
------
This release is probably beta quality i.e. works for me but has not
had a lot of testing and has only been briefly tested under MS
Windows.

Written and tested under:

- Xubuntu 7.10
- Python 2.5.1

Latest version in http://hg.sharesource.org/blogpost/[Mercurial
repository at ShareSource].

See also the http://srackham.wordpress.com/blogpost1/[blogpost(1) man
page].

'blogpost' uses Michele Ferrettiâ€™s
http://www.blackbirdblog.it/programmazione/progetti/28[Python
Wordpress library] and comes with a patched version of the
`wordpreslib.py` library module (the patch added WordPress 'Page'
XML-RPC methods).


Prerequisites
-------------
- Python 2.5 or better (has not been tried with earlier versions).
- http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] (unless you only plan
  to source raw HTML documents).


Installation
------------
- Download from http://hg.sharesource.org/blogpost/[Mercurial
  repository at ShareSource].
- Put `blogpost.py` in search path (optional).
- Create `$HOME/.blogpost` configuration file (see example
  `conf/blogpost_example.conf`).
- Disable 'emoticons' from the Wordpress browser interface (optional):
  1. Login.
  2. Navigate to 'Settings->Writing->Writing Settings' page.
  3. Uncheck 'Convert emoticons' in the 'Formatting' section (this
     stops the automatic conversion of text patterns to emoticons
     emoticons and is optional).

[IMPORTANT]
=====================================================================
As of AsciiDoc 8.3.0 the 'wordpress' backend conf file has been
included in the AsciiDoc distribution. If you are using a verison of
AsciiDoc prior to 8.3.0 you need to install and use the old conf file
-- copy the `conf/wordpress-8.2.7.conf` to the AsciiDoc install,
global configuration or user (`$HOME/.asciidoc`) directory and rename
it `wordpress.conf`.

=====================================================================

Bugs
----
- Under some circumstances WordPress converts three periods to an
  elipsis character and double dashes to the em dashes, there doesn't
  seem to be a way to turn this off.
