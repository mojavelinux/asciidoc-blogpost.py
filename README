'blogpost' is a Wordpress command-line weblog client.  It creates and
updates weblog entries directly from
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] (or HTML) source
documents. You can also delete and list weblog entries from the
command-line.

- Manages WordPress Posts and Pages.
- Automatically uploads media files (images, video, audio).
- Only posts new or modified media files.

This 'blogpost' command creates a blogpost containing images from an
AsciiDoc text file:

$ blogpost.py post blogpost_media_processing.txt

Status
------
Latest version in http://code.google.com/p/blogpost/[Mercurial
repository at Google Code].

See also the http://srackham.wordpress.com/blogpost1/[blogpost(1) man
page].

Current version tested under:

- Xubuntu 12.04
- Python 2.7.3

'blogpost' uses Michele Ferrettiâ€™s
http://www.blackbirdblog.it/programmazione/progetti/28[Python
Wordpress library] and comes with a patched version of the
`wordpreslib.py` library module (the patch added WordPress 'Page'
XML-RPC methods).


Prerequisites
-------------
- Python 2.5 or better (has not been tried with earlier versions).
- http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] (unless you only plan
  to source raw HTML documents).


Installation
------------
- Clone the http://code.google.com/p/blogpost/[Mercurial repository at
  Google Code] to your local machine.
- Put `blogpost.py` in search path (optional).
- Install the Wordpress backend plugin:

  asciidoc --backend install ./conf/wordpress.zip

- Create `$HOME/.blogpost` configuration file (see example
  `conf/blogpost_example.conf`).
- Disable 'emoticons' from the Wordpress browser interface (optional):
  1. Login.
  2. Navigate to 'Settings->Writing->Writing Settings' page.
  3. Uncheck 'Convert emoticons' in the 'Formatting' section (this
     option stops the automatic conversion of text patterns to
     emoticons).

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
As of AsciiDoc 8.6.9 the 'wordpress' backend conf file
`wordpress.conf` is no longer included in the AsciiDoc distribution --
it's included here in the blogpost distribution as a backend plugin
(`conf/wordpress.zip`).

=====================================================================


Bugs
----
- Under some circumstances WordPress converts three periods to an
  elipsis character and double dashes to the em dashes, there doesn't
  seem to be a way to turn this off.
- WordPress does not appear to recognise list numbering styles and all
  numbered lists are rendered with decimal numbering (WordPress
  default theme).
- WordPress nested unordered lists all have the same bullet style
  (WordPress default theme).
- Large posts can result in blank WordPress pages (I experienced this
  posting the AsciiDoc User Guide which is over five thousand lines
  long). The problem seems to be with WordPress:
